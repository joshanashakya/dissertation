"""In this problem you are to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n, but you should take all powers of two with minus in the sum. For example, for n = 4 the sum is equal to  - 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 =  - 4, because 1, 2 and 4 are 20, 21 and 22 respectively. Calculate the answer for t values of n."""from math import floor, log t = int(input())for x in range(t):    n = int(input())    sum_to_n = n*(n+1) // 2    sum_pow_2 = (2 ** (floor(log(n, 2)) + 1)) - 1    res = sum_to_n - 2 * sum_pow_2    print(int(res))
