# Question: K - 1# Assignment 10# Daniel Perez, bd2255  # This algorithm is the most efficent because it recognizes that the coin amount# spent is equal to that of the maximum of current amount to 0 which is the value# the array is equal too when summed up.  # get inputC = int(input()) for i in range(C):    S = int(input())     # converting string list to integers    X = input().split()    FINAL = 0    curr = list(map(int, X))     # taking the maximum of FINAL + element in list over 0     for a in curr:        FINAL = max(FINAL + a, 0)     print(FINAL)
