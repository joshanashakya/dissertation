# Python 3 program to find maximum no of pieces 
# by given number of cuts 
   
# Function for finding maximum pieces 
# with n cuts. 
def findMaximumPieces(n):

    # x is the horizontal cuts 
    x = n // 2
   
    # Now (x) is the horizontal cuts 
    # and (n-x) is vertical cuts, then 
    # maximum number of pieces = (x+1)*(n-x+1) 
    return ((x + 1) * (n - x + 1))
