# Python 3 program to sort array in  
# even and odd manner. The odd 
# numkbers are to be sorted in  
# descending order and the even  
# numbers in ascending order 
  
# To do two way sort. First sort  
# even numbers in ascending order, 
# then odd numbers in descending order. 
def twoWaySort(arr, n): 
  
    # Make all odd numbers negative 
    for i in range(0, n): 
          
        # Check for odd 
        if (arr[i] & 1):  
            arr[i] *= -1
  
    # Sort all numbers 
    arr.sort() 
  
    # Retaining original array 
    for i in range(0, n): 
        if (arr[i] & 1): 
            arr[i] *= -1
