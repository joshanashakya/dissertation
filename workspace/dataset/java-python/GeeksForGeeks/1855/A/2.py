# A space efficeint c++ program to check if  
# all characters of string are unique 
  
# Returns true if all characters of str are  
# unique.  
# Assumptions : (1) str contains only characters  
#                    from 'a' to 'z'  
#                (2) integers are stored using 32  
#                    bits

    # of 26 characters using its 32 bits
