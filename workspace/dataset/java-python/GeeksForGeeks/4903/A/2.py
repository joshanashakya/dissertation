# Python3 program to find Maximum difference  
# between two elements such that larger  
# element appears after the smaller number 
  
# The function assumes that there are  
# at least two elements in array. The  
# function returns a negative value if the 
# array is sorted in decreasing order and  
# returns 0 if elements are equal

    # right side 
    maxRight = arr[n - 1]

        if (arr[i] > maxRight):
